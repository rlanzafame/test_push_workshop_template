    "## Markdown\n",
    "Markdown is a simple markup language: plain text that is *formatted* with small pieces of 'code'. This allows you to create rich, interactive books that combine text, code, and visualizations. This text can then be quickly exported to various other formats such as PDF, Word, HTML, etc.\n",

These can be saved as JSON, or rendered to a website (like this one!) or any number of formats including [PDF & LaTeX](./creating-pdf-documents.md), [Word](./creating-word-documents.md), [React](./quickstart-myst-documents.md), or [JATS](./creating-jats-xml.md).

It also allows to run code cells and display the output directly in the book. Check the output below by first clicking the ON-button at the top right of this page. This loads the server. Once it is ready, you can run the code cell below by clicking the play button."
