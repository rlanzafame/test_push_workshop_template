# Build online with GH Actions

Most of you are probably familiar with GitHub Actions, as it is a widely used tool, especially for easily publishing websites without financial cost. This lesson is designed to get you familiar with GitHub Actions in your Jupyter Book and learn how to manipulate them.

```{tip} Tip &#127798;
The workflow file generated by `jupyter-book init --gh-pages` by &#127798; users is different than that generated by this template, but you can still follow the exercises.
```

```{tip} What is GitHub Actions?
:class: dropdown

If you have no idea, or are confused what and Action is, don't despair! The most simple explanation is that GHA is a tool for automating workflows. For our purposes, you only need to know that GHA is:

- Actions can be carried out on your GitHub repository automatically
- such "workflows" are defined in `.yml` files in the `.github/workflows` folder of your repository
- workflows can be triggered by events, e.g. when you push changes to your repository
- workflows can have multiple steps, e.g. install software, build the book, deploy the book
- GHA is generally free for public repositories, with some limitations on usage for private repositories

```

## Read it

**WIP**
- find the file
- identify the trigger
- describe the environment created
- itendify the steps

## Observe it

**WIP**
- make a commit to the repo
- visit the Actions tab
- observe the workflow running
- dig deeper 

## Break it

**WIP**
- introduce an error
- observe the failure
- fix the error

## Change it

Here we will modify the workflow to add a new feature: automatically updating the "last edited" date in our published book.

The following bash script will modify `date:` field in the `myst.yml` file.

**WIP**
- add to workflow file
- commit, push, observe
- quiz quetsion: what is the date?! file edited, time of commit, time of push, other?... answer = whenever the first line in the code snippet below is executed in the cloud (e.g., time of push + time to set up venv and start build).

```yml
- name: Add current date to myst.yml
  shell: bash
  run: |
      BUILD_DATE="$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')"
      sed -i "s|\${BUILD_DATE}|${BUILD_DATE}|g" myst.yml
      echo "myst.yml:"
      grep -nE '^\s*date:' myst.yml
```

date:  ${BUILD_DATE}
