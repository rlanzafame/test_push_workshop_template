# Get going yourself

Now it's your turn to get going with creating content in a Jupyter Book.

There are some conditions to meet before you can get started:

- Programming experience is not necessary, but it does make things a bit easier.
- A free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- A little bit of patience, it's a steep learning curve.

Optional:
- Software to write your code in, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC).

If you are feeling confident and would rather start building a Jupyter Book from scratch, you can look at [the advanced start](#advanced-start).
:::

We provide instructions for building using the GitHub dev IDE, as well as building locally. For the latter we assume knowledge about VSC, and the use of git.

Ready? Let's get startedâ€¦
