# Introduction

This is the *Jupyter Book 2 Headstart Template,* designed to quickly and easily produce your own online interactive textbook as well as a high quality pdf enabled with Typst using [Jupyter Book 2](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) technology.

```{warning} Work in Progress
Materials in this document are under construction; the contents and order of the information and tasks may change, depending on workshop needs and feedback.
```

This template:
- provides a ready-to-use Jupyter Book 2 structure for creating an online book (i.e., website)
- is pre-configured to produce a high quality pdf using Typst
- includes a number of lessons to get you started understanding key components of a book and how to edit it 
- includes a GitHub Action to automatically build and deploy your book online and as a pdf


Hence, the template allows you to engage with JB2 (and the underlying softawre MyST) without installing any software on your own computer. You only need a web browser and a GitHub account (we provide details on how to work locally on your own computer).

As this document serves both as a template _and_ a guide, it has the following structure:

1. A quick introduction to key Jupyter Book 2, MyST and Markdown concepts.
2. A tutorial with several steps to introduce you to editing and building your own book.
3. Additional resources, for example, [how to work locally on your own computer](./advanced_start.md).


```{note}
The template and its content are not meant as a replacement of the documentation already available on the [Jupyter Book 2 website](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) and the [MyST website](https://mystmd.org/guide). It is designed to support new users of Jupyter Book 2 and MystMD, in particular for use in workshop settings where participants may not have time or ability to install the required software on a personal computer.

```{warning} Enjoyment Warning!
Once you start building JB2 books, it is likely you will get hooked!
