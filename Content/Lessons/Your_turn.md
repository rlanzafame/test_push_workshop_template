# Get going yourself

Now it's your turn to get going with creating content in a Jupyter Book.

There are some conditions to meet before you can get started:

- Programming experience is not necessary, but it does make things a bit easier.
- A free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- A little bit of patience, it's a steep learning curve.

Optional:
- Software to write your code in, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC).
