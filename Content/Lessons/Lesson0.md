# Lesson 0: Headstart with GH template 

This lesson gives you a headstart in creating your own online book using GitHub and the template repository [JB2_book_template](https://github.com/FreekPols/JB2_book_template).


## Set up your own repository

Follow these instruction to use this template for your own book.

1. Go to this [repository](https://github.com/FreekPols/JB2_book_template.git)
2. Click the green button `use this template` and click `create a new repository`.
3. Choose a proper name of your repository (this will be also part of your URL!) and choose the option `public`.
4. In your repository, click on `settings` and in the left menu on Pages and choose `Github actions`

``` {figure} Figures/start.mp4
:name: vid_1

Follow these steps to create your own repository from the template.
```

5. Click on `code` and click on the `gear-icon` (near **About**) at the right site of the page. 
6. Check the box **Use your GitHub Pages website**.
7. Go to `actions` in the topmenu, click on the (red) `initial commit` and click `re-run all jobs`


The book will now be deployed again - where now it can actually load GitHub pages. 


``` {figure} Figures/2ndpart.mp4
:name: vid_2

Follow these steps to create your own GHpages from the template.
```



8. Use the book link  (`code` $\rightarrow$ below **About**) to your Github page where the book is hosted.
9. The output resembles {numref}`Figuur {number} <fig_startscreen>`.

```{figure} Figures/startscreen.png
:name: fig_startscreen
:width: 100%

Once the book has been deploy, you can visit your site which looks like this.
```

## Repo folder structure

Your GitHub repository looks like the one shown in {numref}`fig_folderstructure`. We have the following subfolders:

- Content: the source files of your book (in markdown or jupyter notebook format)
- Exports: the folder which may include a pdf export of your book
- Figures: the folder which includes figures for your book (*could be in content folder*)
- Lessons: the folder which includes the lessons of this tutorial (*could be in Content folder*)
- .github/workflows: the folder which includes the GitHub actions (automated workflows) to build and deploy your book
- css: the folder which includes the custom css file to change the layout of your book
- pdf_template_book: the folder which includes the typst template to create a pdf export of your book

```{figure} Figures/Folderstructure.png
:name: fig_folderstructure
:width: 100%

Once the book has been deploy, you can visit your site which looks like this.
```




## Working in the GitHub development environment

It is possible to work directly in the GitHub environment: no need to install anything as this is already covered with the GH actions that we created.
